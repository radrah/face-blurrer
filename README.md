## Functionalities

This web project allows you to blur your face. It includes a slider to increase and decrease the scale of the  blur and the size of the blur.
The core application is useful for custom-built applications/websites that might want to add the functionality to blur the users face.

If you maximze the scale and size of the blur, you'll look like a minecraft character lol(see below).
